      These accords often blend ozonic, watery notes with hints of citrus or floral to evoke a feeling of serenity and boundless horizons. 
      The aquatic family aims to remind us of the sea's tranquility, its mystery, and its endless expansesâ€”combining gentle marine facets with 
      a slightly salty minerality that resonates with the idea of a clean, pure environment. Such fragrances are perfect for those seeking 
      a calm yet exhilarating sensation that can transform any day into a breezy ocean escape.`,
